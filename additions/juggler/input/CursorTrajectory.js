/**
 * The cursor path `humanize=True` moves along.
 *
 * Camoufox used to generate this in C++ (additions/camoucfg/MouseTrajectories.hpp):
 * a cubic Bezier through two random knots, distorted, then walked with an
 * ease-out and emitted at a flat 10ms cadence. It was replaced by Cursory
 * (cursory/, vendored) because the two differ in what they are imitating. A
 * Bezier is an equation, and an equation sampled at a fixed rate has velocity
 * and jerk profiles that separate cleanly from a hand's; the old path's speed
 * also came entirely from an easing function, so every movement Camoufox ever
 * made accelerated and decelerated the same way. Cursory replays one of 2357
 * movements recorded from real people, morphed onto the requested endpoints,
 * and keeps that recording's own timing -- pauses, overshoots and all.
 *
 * `humanize:engine` = "mousecrack" swaps in a second generator instead
 * (mousecrack/, vendored): a recurrent network trained on recorded movements
 * that synthesizes a new path rather than replaying one. Measured against the
 * same recordings, its medium and long moves are slower and wander more than a
 * hand's or Cursory's, so Cursory stays the default.
 *
 * This module is the whole boundary between Camoufox and both generators: it
 * owns the config, the cadence and the pixel grid, and hands MouseDispatch a
 * plain list of steps.
